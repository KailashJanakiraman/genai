These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\\n3. **Blue light dominance**: Because blue light has a shorter wavelength, it is scattered more efficiently by the tiny molecules in the atmosphere. This means that more blue light is dispersed in all directions, reaching our eyes from all parts of the sky.\\n4. **Angle of the sun**: When the sun is high in the sky, its rays pass through less of the atmosphere, and the sky appears more blue.

The population is 1542, which is a decent size, but the number of households is only 20. Wait, that doesn't make sense. 1542 people in 20 households? That would mean each household has about 77 people, which is impossible. Maybe there's a typo here. Perhaps it's 1542 households instead of population? Or maybe the population is 1542 and households are 20, but that would mean each household has 77 people, which is way too high. Maybe it's a data entry error. Alternatively, perhaps the population is 1542 and households are 20, but that seems unrealistic. Maybe I should proceed with caution, assuming that the data is correct as given.\n",

For example, Example 6497 had a median income of 1.8047 and a house value of 101,800. Another example, Example 9558, had a median income of 1.6148 and a house value of 86,600.\n",

But since the examples sometimes have higher values even with lower incomes, maybe I should consider a bit higher. Let's say around 150,000. Alternatively, considering the very low number of households, which might indicate a small or rural area, perhaps the value is lower. Maybe around 100,000.\n",
